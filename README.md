I am a glaciologist interested in ice sheet dynamics, glacial hydrology, and ice-ocean interactions. My current research aims to assess the influence of crevasse hydrology on the dynamics of the Greenland Ice Sheet. I am using large-scale satellite analysis, including deep learning approaches, to map fractures and water across Greenland, and numerical modelling to investigate the effect on long-term ice-sheet stability.
